            I recommend that you immediately start to write your own blog entries. You could write a short entry every
            time you learned something new about programming. For inspiration I list a few things that you could write
            about:

            What did I learn today?
            Insert screenshots
            Links to helpful websites
            What are the problems I have encountered?
            How did I solve these problems?
            What should I work on the next time?
            With such blog entries you will advance much faster in mastering programming. This is why:

            You will be aware of what you have learned â†’ higher motivation!
            You can look up things in your personal documentation, for example links to helpful sites.
            You will practice HTML and CSS while writing the entries.
            If you publish your website online you can make your blog accessible to others. This enables you to share
            your knowledge or to ask someone to help you with a problem.
            If you publish your portfolio, I would be very interested in having a look at it! Please share your link
            somewhere in the comments below.
            Do not wait too lang and get started right away. It is worth it!
